# Placemeter_API for Lower East Side Partnership

This repository is focused on how to download and plot data from [Placemeter API](https://www.placemeter.com). The data is recorded from sensors around New York City and then analyzed and placed in their database. I have made the following notebook for the [Lower East Side Partnership](http://www.lowereastside.org) in order for them to use the data to provide more efficient humane resource placement and improve their services throughout the neighborhood.
